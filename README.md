# MangoGuard
**What is this?**

 - MangoGuards uses AHK to detect specific events, while TinyTask handles unit placement for you.

 - MangoGuards makes it easier to create and use your own team without having to get certain units to get a mango to work or having to hardcode it into the file just for your team to work
